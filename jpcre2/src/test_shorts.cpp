     *
     * captured groups or substrings are stored in maps/vectors for each match,
     * and each match is stored in a vector.
     * Thus captured groups are in a vector of maps/vectors.
     *
     * PCRE2 provides two types of substrings:
     *  1. numbered (indexed) substring
     *  2. named substring
     *
     * For the above two, we have two vectors respectively:
     *  1. jp::VecNum (Corresponding vector: jp::NumSub)
     *  2. jp::VecNas (Corresponding map: jp::MapNas)
     *
     * Another additional vector is available to get the substring position/number
     * for a particular captured group by name. It's a vector of name to number maps
     *  * jp::VecNtN (Corresponding map: jp:MapNtN)
